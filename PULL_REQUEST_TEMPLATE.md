- [ ] I have followed the [instructions for making a code change](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Make-a-pull-request).
- [ ] I have assigned the correct reviewers to this PR (or will leave a comment with the phrase "@{{reviewer_username}} PTAL" if I don't have permissions to assign reviewers directly).

## Proof that changes are correct

<!--
Add videos/screenshots of the running development server with changes you made in the
`package.json` file to test Guppy changes and simultaneously test the interaction that uses Guppy,
first by creating them and then checking them in the preview tab of the exploration editor,
and please keep the developer console open in the meanwhile so that we can be assured
that changes are not causing any errors.

To be specific, your proof video should cover the following points:
 1. `package.json` file with running development server
 2. Creating the interaction while keeping the developer console open.
 3. Previewing the interaction while keeping the developer console open.

When you make updates to the PR, please update these videos/screenshots as well.
You can remove videos/screenshots from previous versions of the PR.

The above should be done for all PRs, including short ones (e.g., a single-line change).
However, if the changes in your PRs are autogenerated via a script and you cannot
provide proof for the changes, then please leave a comment "No proof of changes
needed because {{Reason}}" and remove all the sections below.-->
